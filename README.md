#SQLGuard - Fullstack Project
SQLi (SQL injection) attacks remain a pervasive threat to database-driven applications, allowing malicious actors to manipulate database queries and gain unauthorized access to confidential information to compromise system integrity. To address this critical concern, this paper presents a Real-time SQLi Monitoring and Detection Dashboard designed for system administrators in organizations to proactively detect, analyze and mitigate SQLi threats as they occur. The proposed solution is tailor-made for security teams managing web applications, particularly those with login systems susceptible to SQLi in real-world scenarios. The key challenge addressed is the lack of real-time visibility in SQLi attacks and the absence of centralized monitoring tools for administrators. Traditional security initiatives often focus on post-attack analysis and mitigation rather than instantaneous detection and response, leaving enterprise systems vulnerable to constant threats. The main goal of this project is to develop a robust, real-time monitoring and detection system that provides immediate alerts, actionable insights and comprehensive security controls. It emphasizes real-time analysis of login attempts and user inputs. The approach involves three crucial components; A flask backend, employing REGEX pattern-based matching to detect SQLi attempts dynamically, a deliberately vulnerable login page built with React which serves as the testbed for simulation of attack scenarios, and a react and tailwind-CSS based dashboard featuring real-time attack logs, chart visualizations of SQLi activity, and configurable security settings. The combination of real-time detection with adequate visualization helps enhance web application security, enforce strong authentication mechanisms and minimize response times. This implementation provides organizations with a practical, user-friendly interface to strengthen their defense against SQLi attacks while offering detailed insights which align with modern cybersecurity frameworks and best practices.
